A Better Explorer filemanager repository

***Beta 3 Update 3***

The point of this branch is to only provide fixes for serious bugs that would hinder the average use of the features in this new version. No new features will be added beyond what's currently here.

This branch will contain the code for what will be Beta 3 Update 3, the last update for Beta 3. This update will include a number of bug fixes, and some small new features, and will also contain some things to prepare users for our next version of Better Explorer.

Our next version is RC 1, and will be based upon an entirely new back-end than the one used up until now. This next version is taking a lot of time to build, though, so we can't offer any timetable as to when it'll be ready.
